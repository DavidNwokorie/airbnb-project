We try to keep the atmosphere conducive to studying and resting and a couple of house-rules are in place to this end.  1. Towels and linens (sheets, blankets, and pillows) are NOT provided. The bed is twin size. 2. No smoking on the premises.  3. No loud music or TV etc.  4. Only for one person (no couples, no visitors). We seldom have visitors, let alone overnight guests.

If you are not sure about your check-out date, you can reserve the minimum days and extend your stay at a discounted rate.  6. Check-in time has to be coordinated at least 48 hours ahead. On arrival, a short registration process with a picture ID is needed in exchange for keys and wifi access.  7. Inside the apartment, we take off our outside shoes. So if you bring your o"
